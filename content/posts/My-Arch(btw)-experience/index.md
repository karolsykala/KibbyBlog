title: 'My Arch(btw) Experience'
---
I've tried running arch linux with hypralnd config called [HyDE](https://github.com/Hyde-project/hyde), which was great, but introduced unnecesary stuff. Could I just read into the documentation and just remove unnecessary components? Sure. Am I going to rice it all by myself? Naturally.

I wanted to swich to arch linux to expand my understanding of linux system components. I see the value of projects like HyDE, but just like with neovim distributions (lazyvim, lunarvim etc.) i see them as a tools for someone that already understands the underlying system and just wants to skip setup time and get to work more quicky. I'm currently in the stage of learning how both arch and wayland work, so it's way more important for me to gather understanding instead of just relying upon templates, that I'm not going to read into.

Lets start with arch installation. Balena etcher gets the job done, arch is ready to be installed again. 
I'm going to use ```archinstall``` script. It's already hard enough for me to get it working (took me 4 times to get my networking work propely :c)
I mostly followed [that](https://youtu.be/E50pt992Ihc?si=-2vsjDzwCp5vInVC) youtube tutorial, explains quite nicely how to get stuff rolling.

With everything installed I'm rebotting into my fresh install, where the first I see is...a black screen...
For some reason that happens every time after a fresh install, let's just ignore that and reboot the system. It fixes the issue :)

Now I'm able to login and the first thing I see is....anime girl....
Maybe that black screen wasn't that bad...
At least there is a cat. :3
