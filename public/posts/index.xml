      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tried running arch linux with hypralnd config called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Hyde-project/hyde&#34;&gt;HyDE&lt;/a&gt;, which was great, but introduced unnecesary stuff. Could I just read into the documentation and just remove unnecessary components? Sure. Am I going to rice it all by myself? Naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to swich to arch linux to expand my understanding of linux system components. I see the value of projects like HyDE, but just like with neovim distributions (lazyvim, lunarvim etc.) i see them as a tools for someone that already understands the underlying system and just wants to skip setup time and get to work more quicky. I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the stage of learning how both arch and wayland work, so it&amp;rsquo;s way more important for me to gather understanding instead of just relying upon templates, that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to read into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
