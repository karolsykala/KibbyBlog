So, I decided to try running Arch Linux with a Hyprland config called [HyDE](https://github.com/Hyde-project/hyde). It was a great experience, but, of course, it introduced some unnecessary bloat. Could I have just read through the documentation and removed the extra components? Sure. Am I going to rice it all by myself? Naturally!

My goal for switching to Arch Linux is to get a deeper understanding of Linux system components. I appreciate projects like HyDE, but I see them as tools for people who already understand the system and just want to get to work faster. Right now, I’m still learning how Arch and Wayland work, so it’s much more important for me to gather knowledge rather than just using pre-built templates that I won’t even read.

### Arch Installation: The Journey Begins

Alright, let’s start with installing Arch. Enter **Balena Etcher**, the hero that gets the job done. Arch is now ready to be installed again. This time, I’m using the `archinstall` script. And let me tell you, it wasn’t smooth sailing. Took me four tries to get the networking to work properly! 

I mostly followed this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/E50pt992Ihc?si=-2vsjDzwCp5vInVC), which explains things quite clearly for us Arch noobs.

### Reboot: The Black Screen Surprise

After the installation, I rebooted into my fresh system and... I’m greeted with a black screen. Classic Arch move, right? Let’s just ignore it and reboot again. Voila! The system fixes itself. 

And then, I log in and — surprise! — the first thing I see is… an anime girl. At least there’s a cat, so maybe that black screen wasn’t so bad after all.

### The Hyprland Config File: Getting Cozy

The fresh install came with an autogenerated Hyprland config file located under `.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`. Time to dig in! But first, big shoutout to [Typecraft](https://youtube.com/@typecraft_dev?si=rc1jtdusGzI4N1Cu) for his excellent videos on Neovim and Linux. He helped me a lot in understanding the [basics of Hyprland](https://youtu.be/2CP_9-jCV6A?si=rUAR0WP_mAPrI0JF).

#### Cleaning Up the Config

First order of business: Get rid of that annoying warning about the autogenerated config file. Easy enough — just delete the line:
```autogenerated = 1 # remove this line to remove the warning```
I also prefer to get rid of unnecessary info, like the link to the Hyprland wiki.

#### Monitors: Scaling the 4K Beast

I’ve got two monitors, but for now, I’m going to focus on just one. I want to force myself to learn the shortcuts instead of using all that screen real estate as a crutch. Under the **#Monitors** section, I adjust the scaling to make things more readable on my 4K display:
```monitor=,preffered,auto,2.0```
Save the file, and boom — the config is applied. No more warning messages, and the interface looks bigger and more comfortable. Nice!

### Programs: Kitty, Wofi, and Waybar

Hyprland comes with a set of programs that work well with the environment, so during installation, I got tools like **kitty** and **wofi**. Since kitty is already set up and working, let’s move on to configuring **Waybar**.

#### Wofi: The Wayland App Launcher

Wofi is one of the most popular program managers on Wayland — straightforward to use. In the **Keybindings** section, you’ll notice that navigating around Hyprland relies heavily on `$mainMod + key` combinations. To launch Wofi, we use `$mainMod + R`.

But hey, I like to tweak things to my preferences. I’m going for a MacOS-inspired setup, so instead of `$mainMod + R`, I’m changing it to:
`bind = $mainMod, space, exec, $menu` 
Wofi is perfectly usable right now, so I won’t bother ricing it further. Time to move on to the more exciting stuff.

#### Waybar: Adding Some Spice

First, install Waybar:

``sudo pacman -S waybar``

Now, run it with:
``waybar``
You should see something like this:
![image](./images/default-waybar.jpeg)
But wait, where are the icons? No worries! Just install the missing fonts with:
```sudo pacman -S ttf-font-awesome```

After running `waybar` again, the icons should be there, and everything looks much cooler.

If you're like me and not a designer genius, I recommend grabbing one of the example configs and tweaking it to your liking. I got mine from [here](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Examples). But if you’re feeling adventurous and want to make something from scratch, here’s a basic config to get you started:

  

Create a new folder under `.config` called `waybar` and add a `config.jsonc` file with this basic setup:

```
{
    "layer": "top",
        "modules-left": ["hyprland/workspaces", "hyprland/mode"],
        "modules-center": ["hyprland/window"],
        "modules-right": ["battery", "clock"],
    "sway/window": {
        "max-length": 50
    },
        "battery": {
            "format": "{capacity}% {icon}",
            "format-icons": ["", "", "", "", ""]
    
    },
    "clock": {
        "format-alt": "{:%a, %d. %b %H:%M}"
    }

}

```

If you’re on a desktop, you can remove the battery section.

### Autostart: Making Life Easier

Now let’s dive into the **Autostart** section. Every time we log in, we can specify which programs should start automatically. In the `hyprland.conf` file, there’s an example:
``# exec-once = waybar & hyprpaper & firefox``
For simplicity, let’s uncomment that line and leave only `waybar` for now:
``exec-once = waybar``
Now, press **Super + M** to log out, then log back in. If everything went well, Waybar should autostart.

### Final Thoughts

And that’s it for now! I’m still learning and tweaking, but Hyprland is definitely growing on me. Expect more updates as I continue my journey through the world of Arch Linux, Wayland, and, of course, cats :3
